# War - Card-Game Simulator
Website version of the card game War. 

This website allows the user to simulate the popular card game War. War is a 2 player card game that utilizes a standard 52 playing card deck. Each player is given a randomized half of the deck (26 cards). In each round they both flip one card face up from the top of their pile and the cards are matched against each other. The player that flips over the highest value card wins the round (ace is the highest value, 2 is the lowest value). If both players flip over a card of the same value, WAR is declared and a War round starts. In a War round, each player deals 3 face down cards into a pile, and then flips over the next card and the higher value card wins. This round repeats if the cards revealed are the same value again. The round winner collects all the cards used in the round and keeps them in a separate pile. When both players run out of cards, the game is over and whoever has won the most cards is the game winner.
